# Needle Calibration Process

Calibration of a steerable needle may entail the following:
  - Calibration of rotational offset of 6DOF sensor to bevel plane
  - Flexure tip needle positional offset + bevel plane rotational offset
  - Torsional windup characterization
    - 6DOF Case: We can read the sensor roll angle directly
    - 5DOF Case: We attach a colored marker to the tip and use MATLAB Computer Vision Toolbox to measure roll angle
