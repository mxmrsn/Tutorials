# In Vivo Experimental Set-Up

## Ahead of Time
- Inbar schedules the BRIC
- Ron orders the pig
- Inbar schedules the vet team
## Schedule
Arrival Day
- Test any code changes
- Test networking (communication between the computers)
- If necessary test fit the stylets in the wrists

Day One
This day is to determine scanner parameters and give us a dry run with the vet team. We also acquaint the CT Tech with the scanning parameters and do a first pass on segmentation.
- Meet at Sitterson
  - Always bring ex vivo lungs as a back up
  - Always bring ex vivo stuff as a back up
- Can test fit and mark the steerable needles in the wrists (and the stylets)

Day Two
- Meet at Sitterson (move equipment if necessary)
- Experiment Set-Up
  - Animal Set-Up
  - Robot/Tracking Set-Up
- Scan the animal once on a breath-hold
- Transfer the scan to the segmentation Laptop
- Perform segmentation
- Run experiment
  - Note that the steers for in vivo experiments run in a piecewise fashion which needs to be aligned with the breath-holds someone needs to run a 10 second timer while the vet team conducts the breath hold and someone manually commands the controller to start the steer for the next segment from the robot computer.
  - After the steer scan again
  - Retract the system
  - Repeat


## Ventilation Setup
- For in vivo, the vet team has a bellows ventilator (volume based)
  - They determine the maximum allowable pressure (without causing damage to the lungs) it is usually 30 cm of H20
   - They then adjust the ventilation volume to insert as much air as possible without going over 30 cm H20

- On the air circuit it is helpful to install a 10 cm of H20 PEEP Valve
   - The pressure will start to drop during the ventilation pattern and the PEEP valve will help control the pressure drop to encourage air to stay in the lung and help avoid lung collapse

## Pig SetUp
- Pig should be 100 kg or larger *should fit in the bore of the scanner though :)
- Need to remind the vet team to administer paralytic every 20min, since this isn't a survival study they can administer a greater amount
- The legs need to be secured to the table with tape but they also need to fit through the bore of the scanner
- The pig should be on its back
- push the pig all the way to the scanner end of the table so that the robot fits at the back end
- Wrap each connection on the air circuit
- Paralytic Rocurium Bromide 10mg/mL administered through a syringe pump

## Scanning the Pig
- Scanning Parameters advised by Dr. Rai Lee
  - Influenced by animal size, relative to depth of tissue
  - 140 kV, 340 amps X Ray Current, 0.85 Spiral Pitch, 0.74 x 0.74 x 1.5 mm Voxel Size
- Need the lead shield and the aprons (Inbar handles this)
- Done on a breath hold
